# Find Best Combination

## About

Provides customers with the best possible product combination on your PrestaShop e-commerce store. When you have a product with multiple attributes but only a few combinations exist, this module will always make sure that your customers are provided with the best possible combination. This prevents the customer from having to deal with Ajax errors, and allow them to buy your product as quickly as possible.
